# bash-scripts
This is a random collection of useful shell scripts that I have accumulated over time. To use them, make sure you mark them as executable and place them in a folder on the path. My preferred location is ~/bin/.

* **`compiler`:** Script to compile LaTeX files into PDFs. Syntax is `compiler myfile.tex` which produces `myfile.pdf` in the working directory.
* **`compilerClean`:** Script to compile LaTeX files into PDFs, but also remove all ancillary files that are not `.tex` source or `.pdf` output. Syntax is `compilerClean myfile.tex` which produces `myfile.pdf` in the working directory and deletes all intermediate compilation files.
* **`ducustom`:** Custom disk usage that displays files sorted by size (largest to smallest) with arbitrary folder depth, e.g. `ducustom 2` lists all files and directories in the current folder as well as its subfolder. Helpful for finding large files.
* **`find_replace_in_files`:** Find and replace text in all files of a (set of) directories. Useful if workflow is dependent on file paths, and you just migrated servers.
* **`find_replace_in_files_input`:** Similar to find_replace_in_files, but it allows you to execute the command from the terminal at the top of the directory tree you want to make changes in.
* **`git_find_big`:** Find large files in a git tree. Found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10622179/how-to-find-identify-large-files-commits-in-git-history).
* **`pdf2eps`:** Convert PDF files to EPS format. Found [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/20883/how-to-convert-pdf-to-eps).
* **`ps2eps`:** Convert PS files to EPS format (i.e. "encapsulate" them). Found [here](http://aty.sdsu.edu/~aty/bibliog/latex/PSandEPS.html).
* **`shellexec`:** Submit a generic shell script using `nohup` and send email upon completion.
* **`statampbatch`:** Sample SLURM script for running a program in Stata-MP. Note that SLURM configurations differ by server, so check with your admin before attempting to use this.
* **`*hup`:** Commands for submitting various statistical program scripts using `nohup` and sending email upon completion. Includes capabilities for Julia, Matlab, R, Stata, and SAS.

Finally, many of these files were created with the help of [Jared Ashworth](https://github.com/jaredashworth), which I gratefully acknowledge.
